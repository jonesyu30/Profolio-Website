            <h2 class="section-title">Chapter 0: The Background</h2>
<p>One of my 3 electives in my Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination(HKDSE) is Information and Communication Technology(ICT). Which basically means computer. And SBA is just a short form for School Based Assessment, where a small portion of our exam score was taken through school projects, instead of sitting in the examination venue.</p>
<p>Now, with all all the basic terminologies explained, here is the requirement for my specific SBA: a video game. </p>
<p>Here are the list of required features: We were required to create a video game in any programming language, with features: reading and writing files, processing user input, sorting algorithms, in order to showcase our understanding in programming. </p>
<h2 class="section-title">Chapter 1: Game Design</h2>
<p>After brainstormming and procrastinating for days, I have decided on a maze game. With a leaderboard system that would satisfy both File I/O, and sorting requirements. Such a fun game. </p>
<h2 class="section-title">Chapter 2: Final product</h2>
<p>Another requirement is a documentation about the program's design and algorithms. As it is my first time documenting any projects, I searched up many references online, and hand-typed (0 Ai generated) a word document and submitted as PDF. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jonesyu30/Maze-Game/blob/main/6C%2018%20Yu%20Chung%20Yau%20-%20ICT%20SBA%20documentation.pdf">Here</a> is a github link to the submitted PDF for reference. </p>
<p>Lastly, the most important thing of this project - the Final Score. I got 20/20 in SBA, which is just perfect. And the total score of SBA is 5*, which is good enough. :D</p>
