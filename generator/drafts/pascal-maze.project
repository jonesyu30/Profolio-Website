##第一章：背景
相信大部分香港人都會考DSE，而撳得入黎嘅，應該都對ICT有一定嘅興趣。喺依度，就以過來人嘅身分同大家講解下今次SBA嘅過程同埋心得，想攞高分啲嘅就唔好走開喇～

*由於係SBA，顧名思義就係間間學校都有啲唔同，所以下面嘅內容只作參考。

##第二章：要求
到畢業前一年嘅新年，老師就同我地講解左SBA嘅要求：整一個game，嘅同時運用晒全年學過嘅嘢，例如
1. Array/Linked list
2. File I/O
3. Input handling
4. Sorting/Searching
5. Documentation

（唔太識翻譯做中文，請自行Google）

##第三章：計畫
咁第一步就係要決定整咩game啦。遊戲依個題目其實超級空泛，你可以用任何library，任何programming language，即係就算你整個3A大作出黎交功課，佢都吹你唔漲。不過睇返我有嘅時間，仲要兼顧其他科目嘅成績，都係做好bare minimum就算（翻譯：可以做幾少就做幾少）。

最後我決定左做一個迷宮，附上一個leaderboard。因為有leaderboard就可以做埋File I/O，同時做埋Sorting & Array，一舉三得，基本上全部嘢得晒，何樂而不為🤓？迷宮嘅另外一個原因就係可以用啲難啲嘅algorithm，黎自動生成一個迷宮，希望再攞多啲啲分。就係最後嗰0.5分都要攞盡佢。

##第四張：結果
大家可以喺<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jonesyu30/Maze-Game/blob/main/6C%2018%20Yu%20Chung%20Yau%20-%20ICT%20SBA%20documentation.pdf">依度</a>睇倒我最後交左嗰份documentation。全份都係100%人手打出黎，全天然無加工（冇AI），主要係嗰陣都未有依家嗰啲AI咁信得過。

然後到大家最在意嘅分數，就係滿分💯，20/20。完。希望大家都攞倒超級高分，學業進步，步步高升，生意興隆。多謝多謝。


//##Chapter 0: The Background
//One of my 3 electives in my Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination(HKDSE) is Information and Communication Technology(ICT). Which basically means computer. And SBA is just a short form for School Based Assessment, where a small portion of our exam score was taken through school projects, instead of sitting in the examination venue.
//
//Now, with all all the basic terminologies explained, here is the requirement for my specific SBA: a video game. 
//
//Here are the list of required features: We were required to create a video game in any programming language, with features: reading and writing files, processing user input, sorting algorithms, in order to showcase our understanding in programming. 
//
//##Chapter 1: Game Design
//After brainstormming and procrastinating for days, I have decided on a maze game. With a leaderboard system that would satisfy both File I/O, and sorting requirements. Such a fun game. 
//
//##Chapter 2: Final product
//Another requirement is a documentation about the program's design and algorithms. As it is my first time documenting any projects, I searched up many references online, and hand-typed (0 Ai generated) a word document and submitted as PDF. <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jonesyu30/Maze-Game/blob/main/6C%2018%20Yu%20Chung%20Yau%20-%20ICT%20SBA%20documentation.pdf">Here</a> is a github link to the submitted PDF for reference. 
//
//Lastly, the most important thing of this project - the Final Score. I got 20/20 in SBA, which is just perfect. And the total score of SBA is 5*, which is good enough. :D
